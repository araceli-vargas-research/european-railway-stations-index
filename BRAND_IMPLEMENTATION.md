# CCC 2026 Brand Implementation

This dashboard applies the 2026 Consumer Choice Center brand guide to the web interface.

## Core colors
- Autumn Orange: `#E95C1F`
- Leila / Navy: `#22264E`
- Base White: `#FFFFFF`
- Warm White: `#FFF7EF`
- Cool Mist: `#E7ECF4`
- Slate Blue: `#6F789B`

Auxiliary chart colors use the approved tertiary palette:
Marigold, Deep Teal, Bright Teal, Brick Coral, Sand Beige, and Soft Mint.

## Typography
- Headlines: Montserrat Bold
- Subheads: Montserrat Medium / Regular
- Body and descriptive copy: Hind / Montserrat
- Technical data can use the default monospace rendering where appropriate.

The CSS imports Montserrat and Hind from Google Fonts at runtime and falls back to standard sans-serif fonts if unavailable.

## Dashboard translation
The guide is intended primarily for communications and policy outputs, so the dashboard adapts rather than literally copies print layouts:
- navy is the dominant structural color;
- orange is reserved for primary emphasis and calls to attention;
- warm white and cool mist are used as light surfaces;
- metric cards use restrained orange accents;
- charts use only CCC-approved palette colors;
- hierarchy stays clean and simple.

## Logo
A lightweight CSS mark and wordmark are used in the development prototype so no logo asset file has to be embedded.
Before public launch, replace this with an approved official CCC logo asset supplied by the communications team.
